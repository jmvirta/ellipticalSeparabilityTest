# ellipticalSeparabilityTest
This repository contains R-code related to the manuscript "Asymptotic test of covariance separability for matrix elliptical data" by Virta and Matsuda (2025+).

The manuscript proposes a new test for the null hypothesis of separability, $H_0: \Sigma = \Sigma_2 \otimes \Sigma_1$, i.e., that the covariance matrix of the data can be expressed as a product of two smaller covariance matrices. The asymptotic null distribution of the test statistic is derived under the matrix elliptical family.

Preprint available in *add here*.

All code is in R.

The code files are:

- code_algorithm.R, implementations of the proposed test and the Gaussian likelihood ratio test for the same null hypothesis
