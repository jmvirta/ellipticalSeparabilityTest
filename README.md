# ellipticalSeparabilityTest
This repository contains R-code related to the manuscript "Asymptotic test of covariance separability for matrix elliptical data" by Virta and Matsuda (2026+).

The manuscript proposes two new tests for the null hypothesis of separability, $H_0: \Sigma = \Sigma_2 \otimes \Sigma_1$, i.e., that the covariance matrix of the data can be expressed as a Kronecker product of two smaller covariance matrices. The asymptotic null distributions of the test statistic are derived under the matrix elliptical family.

Preprint available in *add here*.

All code is in R.

The code files are:

- code_test.R, implementations of the proposed tests and the Gaussian likelihood ratio test for the same null hypothesis
